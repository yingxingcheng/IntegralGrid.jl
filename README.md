## About

[IntegralGrid](https://github.com/yingxingcheng/IntegralGrid.jl) is a Julia package inspired by the Python package [grid](https://github.com/theochem/grid).
It provides a comprehensive set of tools for numerical integration, interpolation, and differentiation.

Built with the scientific community in mind, [IntegralGrid](https://github.com/yingxingcheng/IntegralGrid.jl) offers advanced features tailored for quantum chemistry applications, including support for density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and periodic boundary conditions.

While [IntegralGrid](https://github.com/yingxingcheng/IntegralGrid.jl) shares similarities with the Python package [grid](https://github.com/theochem/grid), it has been developed specifically for the Julia programming language, leveraging its high-performance capabilities and providing an intuitive interface for Julia users.
